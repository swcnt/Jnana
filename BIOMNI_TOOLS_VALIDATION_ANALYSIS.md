## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT LIMITATIONS

### Authentication Issues
- Biomni requires API authentication (Anthropic Claude API)
- Current setup shows: "Could not resolve authentication method"
- Need to configure API keys for full functionality

- When Biomni unavailable, system uses enhanced fallback analysis
- Provides conservative confidence scores (typically 0.5)
- Limited to basic literature analysis without specialized tools

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL BIOMNI INTEGRATION

### 1. Authentication Setup
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or configure in environment variables
```

### 2. Enhanced Configuration
- Update models.yaml with proper API credentials
- Configure LangChain compatibility settings
- Test Biomni agent initialization

### 3. Validation Enhancement
- Enable all 6 Biomni tools for comprehensive analysis
- Implement domain-specific validation rules
- Add experimental protocol databases
