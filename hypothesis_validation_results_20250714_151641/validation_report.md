**Metrics Breakdown:**
- Testability: 0.800
- Specificity: 0.500
- Grounded Knowledge: 0.300
- Predictive Power: 0.500
- Parsimony: 0.500
- Feasibility: 0.400

**Description:** This hypothesis suggests that p53 is activated by lower levels of telomere damage than CHK1 or CHK2, making it a more sensitive and potent mediator of the G2/M checkpoint. This is supported by higher ...

### H39: ATM Activation by POT1 Depletion May Result from Secondary Intra
**Confidence:** 0.480 [0.380, 0.580]

**Metrics Breakdown:**
- Testability: 0.800
- Specificity: 0.500
- Grounded Knowledge: 0.300
- Predictive Power: 0.500
- Parsimony: 0.500
- Feasibility: 0.300

**Description:** This hypothesis proposes two possible mechanisms for ATM activation following POT1 depletion: (1) secondary intra-chromosomal DNA damage caused by telomere uncapping, or (2) direct activation of ATM b...

### H17: Human and Mouse Telomeres Exhibit Evolutionary Divergence in Shelterin Composition and Function, Affecting DNA Damage Response Pathways
**Confidence:** 0.460 [0.360, 0.560]

**Metrics Breakdown:**
- Testability: 0.500
- Specificity: 0.500
- Grounded Knowledge: 0.400
- Predictive Power: 0.500
- Parsimony: 0.500
- Feasibility: 0.400

**Description:** This hypothesis suggests that, due to evolutionary divergence, human and mouse telomeres differ in shelterin composition (e.g., single human POT1 vs. two mouse POT1 isoforms) and function, leading to ...
